# cUSTOMa

**cUSTOMa** is a small front-end application designed to facilitate the creation and reading of our user stories. 

I thought of this project in anticipation of simplifying the editing of the user stories that we'll have to make for our final projects assignments.

## Meet the current version of cUSTOMa :

## A quick guide to .cUSTOMa.

**.cUSTOMa.** provides you with **three automatic registrations** for the **“USER” | “ADMIN” | “VISITOR” inputs**, with specially chosen **colors** to be **easily distinguishable**. 

However, **you can handle any other words with any other color you may want to** !

More, **.cUSTOMa.** embeds the possibility to **switch to a dark-mode**.
